Name: Gary Davis, This is my work for CST-135.

This application is designed for a vending machine dispensing system. As of now there are two classes, product and dispensing. The product class is configured for a product name, product cost and product quantity. The product objects created will be associated to the dispensing class. The dispensing class will hold all the information needed for the dispensing system. The dispensing system will hold all the information using arrays. The arrays used will hold the product name, product location, product cost and product quantity. Only the required information will be supplied to the customer in order to complete the transaction.
